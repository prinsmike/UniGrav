# UniGrav
A simple utility to calculate the force of gravity between two objects using Newton's universal law of gravity. Written in Python, just for fun.

## Examples

### Calculate the average gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon:

```
./unigravj.py 5.972e+24 7.34767309e+22 3.84402e+8
```

Result:

```
1.98186531951e+20 N
```

### Calculate the average gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth:

```
./unigrav.py 1.989e+30 5.972e+24 149.6e+9
```

Result:

```
3.54215193559e+22
```
